I wish I had talked my heart out to my son and told him how much I loved him,
I wish I had not prioritized my work and been there with him on his birthday
I wish I had listened to him when he felt alone
I wish I could go back in time and hold his hand and stop him from taking that drastic step of ending his life.

Unfortunately many parents around had this realization only after their dear ones succumbed to depression.
Nuclear families technological development and ifestyle has lost the human connection. The biggest challenege in this is unlike
some other health problems this one is not eay to detect and not many people suffering from it some out and talk about it.
There are cases where the families do not realize if one of their member is suffering from depresssion and often confuse it with
mood swings. Barriers to effective care  include a lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers,
and social stigma associated with mental disorders.

Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low selfworth, disturbed sleep or appetite,
feelings of tiredness, and poor concentration. Depression can be longlasting or recurrent, substantially impairing an individualâ€™s ability to
function at work or school or cope with daily
life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide. Depressive disorders include two main sub-categories:
major depressive disorder / depressive episode, which involves symptoms such as depressed mood,
loss of interest and enjoyment, and decreased energy; depending on the number and severity of
symptoms, a depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe; and
dysthymia, a persistent or chronic form of mild depression; the symptoms of dysthymia are similar
to depressive episode, but tend to be less intense and last longer

The person who is depressed is not likely to go out to talk about it openly and keeps getting deeper into the cycle.
The key here is not to expect him to come out but hav a targetted approach to first detect the children prone to any such mental health
issues and ensure proper guidance/ care is given to them.

Depression is a cruel disease thatc can affect anyone . It is very easy once the symtoms begin for a person to slide down the backhole of depression where the symptoms spiral and feed off of each other increasing in severity. - Michelle London PsyD

We see there are several online quiz and games where you can validate if you have the symptoms of being depressed, however there is basic flaw with this
model that is that the person who is having suicidal thoughts and mentally unhealthy is highly unlikely to go online and make use of
all these resources. We propose to bring them to a common platform where we bring the diagnosis within there daily chores.
School going students have fixed timings of different classes and generally have an extra hour for playtyime and all leisure acticites.
We propose to utilised a fraction of this spare time to involve them in playing online games.

The catch here is that there are no actual questions which the subject has to anwer rather there will be situation based and the set of responses will be used to judge the mentall state of the suubject.

There responses from these games will be recoreded and the physcatraist will be able to draw patterns and identify the patterns of poor mental health.
Some of the key attributes that can be identifies are
Aggression
Loneliness
empathy
Hopeless Outlook
Lost interest
Fatigue
Anxiety
Irritability

etc.
Once these are identified we can alert there parents and ask for there involvement asap. We can have counselling sessions.
The beauty of this model is that it is highly scalable from students to corporate worls and this model has the potential to  evolve with time.
We can add more questions introduce games and all the responses that we receive can be part of a big data lake which can further
be utilised to run Lachine learning algorithms.
